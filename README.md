# Climate-Data
Changes in overall climate, such as global warming, have the capacity to impact all aspects of the planet from weather patterns and storm intensity to individual ecosystems and habitats. Being able to observe, analyze, and predict the trends of the changes is crucial in addressing and preventing future damage from being done. The purpose of this notebook is to compare the average sea surface temperature of the southern and arctic oceans and forecast change in average temperature into the future.

# Description
The datasets used come from the ERA5, which observes hourly global climate measurements. This project focuses on the s southern and arctic oceans.

# Requirements
This project utilizes free and open source materials such as the Python libraries used for analysis and visualization (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy) and datasets which can be found in this repository. 

# Data
The data used for this project includes two dataframes, one containing measurements on the Southern Ocean and one on the Arctic Ocean. This project focuses on the sea surface temperature observed in each ocean. 

Southern ocean dataset: https://github.com/gsheara/Climate-Data/blob/0fa908aa0de88fbe7457d8b925c8cfe6356c8c41/southern.csv

Arctic ocean dataset: https://github.com/gsheara/Climate-Data/blob/0fa908aa0de88fbe7457d8b925c8cfe6356c8c41/arctic.csv

# Data processing
The data was analyzed and visualized using a moving average of the daily signal of the sea surface temperatures.
